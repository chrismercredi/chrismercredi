## About Me
Hi there! I'm currently exploring the exciting worlds of **Flutter**, **Dart**, and **Machine Learning**. My journey has been both challenging and rewarding, and Iâ€™m committed to leveling up my skills every day.

## Current Focus
ðŸŽ“ I'm actively engaged in learning through **Coursera**, working through courses to enhance my understanding of:
- **Mobile app development** with **Flutter**.
- Programming fundamentals and advanced features of **Dart**.
- **Machine Learning** concepts and their real-world applications.

## Goals
- Build beautiful, high-performance apps using **Flutter**.
- Apply **Machine Learning** models in apps to solve real-world problems.
- Understand and apply best practices in both app development and AI/ML.
- Contribute to open-source projects and showcase my progress here on GitHub.
